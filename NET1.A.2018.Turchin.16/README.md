# NET1.A.2018.Turchin.16

1. Develop a generalized class-collection [BinarySearchTree][BinaryTree] (binary search tree). Consider using a plug-in interface to implement an order relationship. Implement three ways of traversing the tree: straight (Preorder), cross (Inorder), reverse (Postorder): to implement use the block iterator (yield).  
Test the developed class using the following types:
  - System.Int32 (use default comparison and plug-in comparator);
  - System.String (using the default comparator and connected);
  - User-defined Book class, for which objects order relations are implemented (use default comparison and plug-in comparator);
  - A custom Point structure for which objects do not have order relationships (use a plug-in comparator).
