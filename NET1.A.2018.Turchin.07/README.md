# NET1.A.2018.Turchin.07  

1. Implement a method of sorting a non-rectangular ("jagged") integer array in such a way that it is possible, in particular,
to order the rows of the matrix:
 * In ascending(descending) order of the sum of the elements of the matrix rows;
 * In ascending(descending) order of the maximum elements of the matrix rows;
 * In ascending(descending) order of the minimal elements of the matrix rows.

All efficiency is checked by [NUnit][1] tests in this repository.
