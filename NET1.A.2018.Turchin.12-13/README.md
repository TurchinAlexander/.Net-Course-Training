# NET1.A.2018.Turchin.12

1. Develop a class to simulate a [countdown clock][timer] that implements the ability to pass a message and
additional information about an event to any event-subscribing type after the assigned time
(the time-out is provided to the class by the user). Provide the ability to subscribe to an event
in multiple classes.  
Demonstrate how the class works in a [console application][console].
